# Minute Notepad
Minute Notepad is an app for when you need a place to type something but you have no reason to save it. It is a website with a text box that you can type in, and that's all. No fonts, no styling, just a simple text field. When you refresh or leave the page all your work is gone, no need to delete or store extra files.

# Use cases
- Writing down a phone number.
- Doing quick mathematical computations. Like splitting a bill with friends.
- Creating a shopping list (could be a dangerous decision).
- When you want to send a long message to someone that might require editing.

# What to expect in V1
A text field that you can type in. That's it, expect nothing else...
Ok maybe also two buttons for changing text size. But that's it.
